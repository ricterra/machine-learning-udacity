# Machine Learning Projects by Udacity

Machine Learning nanodegree is an online course provided by Udacity. This program is an intensive course for training in neural networks, algorithms and programs training using real-life exercises. The course is divided into 3 parts: Programming using Python/PyTorch, Machine Learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurring Neural Networks (RNN), sentiment prediction models using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with help of Kaggle and AWS.

## Project 1

<b>Brief description:</b> A sentiment analysis model was built and deployed using recurrent neural network (RNN) over a IMDB (Internet Movie Database) dataframe of movie reviews. This data set contains about 25k reviews written in full sentences and labeled as positive and negative 50:50. Important notice that this project uses AWS tools, such as, SageMaker, a ML platform that help us keep tracking of training jobs, endpoints and computational resources. Besided that, I also used S3 storage system, Lambda function and API gateway to land a simple html page to allow external inputs to the model.


## Project 2

<b>Brief description:</b> In this project, a plagiarism detector is built in order to examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. Detecting plagiarism is an active area of research; the task is non-trivial and the differences between paraphrased answers and original work are often not so obvious.
